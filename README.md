# Bookmark Manager Project with Vanilla JavaScript! ✨

# This is project using vanilla JavaScript to create a Bookmark Manager, a practical application for organizing and storing website bookmarks. This project is showcasing the ability to build functional applications from scratch.

In this project: 
✅ I implemented local Storage to persist bookmark data across sessions. 
✅ I created a dynamic table to display bookmarks with options to visit or delete them. 
✅ I added URL validation and duplicate name checking to ensure a robust user experience. 
✅ I used SweetAlert2 for user-friendly error and warning notifications.

While this project is simple, it solidified my understanding of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and local storage, preparing me for more advanced challenges in my larger projects, such as Live Demo: freshcart-lovat.vercel.app.
